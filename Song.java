/* 
A variable starts with a valid letter, or a $, or a _. No other symbols or numbers can begin a variable name. 1stPlace and *Gazer are not valid variable names.

valid var names: The first letter is uncapitalized, there are no underscores, and each non-starting word is capitalized. 

Variable names of only one word are spelled in all lowercase letters. Variable names of more than one word have the first letter lowercase while the beginning letter of each subsequent word is capitalized. This style of capitalization is called camelCase.
